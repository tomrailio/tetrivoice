...some feedbacks on the itch.io:

I couldnâ€™t get my voice recognised. Even with Chromium (thanks for the link to Firefox documentation).

 
Sorry to hear that, but thanks for trying! From what I remember testing on my Ubuntu installation (where I did not want to install Chrome initially), Chromium did not work for me either. While Firefox worked once the settings changes were made, it seems to only recognize one word/phrase and then stop listening. If you want to confirm this you can open up the browser console and it should be relaying any recognized words/statements back to you.

As far as I know these issues are due to current limitations in the Web Speech API and Firefox not working with continuous recognition. I want to continue improving the game so I will be attempting to swap to a universal voice recognition API and try to ensure it's working in as many browsers as possible.
